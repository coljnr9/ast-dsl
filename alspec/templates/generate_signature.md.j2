Write the **signature only** (no axioms) for an algebraic specification of the following system:

{{ domain_description }}

Follow the methodology from the reference to analyze the domain:
1. Identify all sorts (state sort, parameter sorts, result sorts)
2. Classify functions: constructors, observers, constants, uninterpreted
3. Mark partial functions
4. Identify equality predicates for key dispatch
5. Determine the generated sort(s) and their constructors

Output Python code that defines:
- All variables used in axioms (using `var(...)`)
- A `sig = Signature(...)` with all sorts, functions, and predicates
- A `generated_sorts = { ... }` dict mapping each generated sort name to a tuple of its constructor names

Do NOT write any axioms. A later stage will handle axiom generation using an obligation table derived from your signature.

Call the submit_signature tool with your analysis and signature code.
The eventual spec function will be named `{{ fn_name }}`.
