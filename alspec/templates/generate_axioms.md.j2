Write the complete algebraic specification for the following system:

{{ domain_description }}

## Previously Generated Signature

A previous stage produced the following signature. Use it exactly as given — do not modify sorts, functions, or predicates.

```python
{{ signature_code }}
```

## Obligation Table

The following obligation table was derived deterministically from the signature.
Every cell represents an axiom you must write. Cover every cell.

{{ obligation_table_md }}

## Instructions

Write a complete Python function named `{{ fn_name }}` that returns a `Spec`.
- Reuse the exact signature from above (copy it into your function)
- Write axioms covering **every obligation cell** in the table above
- Write any additional axioms noted in the table (equality basis, definedness biconditionals)
- For miss cells: write delegation/preservation axioms
- For hit cells: write the domain-specific equation or predicate assertion
- Follow the loose semantics rules from the reference: use explicit `¬def(...)` for undefinedness

Call the submit_spec tool with your analysis and code.
