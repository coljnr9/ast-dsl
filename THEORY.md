## Formal Foundations

This project implements a fragment of many-sorted first-order logic with partial functions, following the Common Algebraic Specification Language (CASL). The two primary references are:

- Astesiano et al., "CASL: The Common Algebraic Specification Language" (2001)
- Sannella & Tarlecki, *Foundations of Algebraic Specification and Formal Software Development* (2012)

What follows are the formal definitions that ground the DSL's design. When in doubt about whether a spec is correct, check it against these definitions — not against pattern similarity to existing examples.

## Signatures

A many-sorted signature **Σ = (S, F, P)** consists of:

- **S**: a set of *sort names*
- **F**: a set of *function symbols*, each with a profile **f : s₁ × s₂ × ... × sₙ → s** where all sᵢ and s are in S. A function with n = 0 is a *constant*. Each function is either *total* or *partial* (written →?).
- **P**: a set of *predicate symbols*, each with a profile **p : s₁ × s₂ × ... × sₙ** (no result sort — predicates hold or don't hold).

A signature is **well-formed** when every sort reference appearing in any function or predicate profile is declared in S.

## Terms and Well-Sortedness

Given a signature Σ and a set of typed variables X = {x₁ : s₁, x₂ : s₂, ...}, the set of **well-sorted Σ-terms** T(Σ, X) is defined inductively:

1. Every variable x : s is a term of sort s.
2. If f : s₁ × ... × sₙ → s is in F, and t₁, ..., tₙ are terms of sorts s₁, ..., sₙ respectively, then **f(t₁, ..., tₙ)** is a term of sort s.
3. Constants (0-ary functions) c : → s yield the term **c** of sort s.

A term is **ill-sorted** if any function is applied to arguments whose sorts do not match its declared profile. Well-sortedness is the single most important static check — an ill-sorted equation is meaningless, not merely wrong.

## Formulas

Formulas are built from terms but are categorically distinct from them. A term *denotes a value* in a carrier set; a formula *denotes a truth value*. The grammar:

- **t₁ = t₂** (equation) — where t₁ and t₂ are terms of the *same sort*
- **p(t₁, ..., tₙ)** (predicate application) — where the tᵢ match the profile of p
- **¬φ, φ₁ ∧ φ₂, φ₁ ∨ φ₂, φ₁ ⇒ φ₂, φ₁ ⇔ φ₂** (logical connectives over formulas)
- **∀x : s • φ, ∃x : s • φ** (quantification)
- **def(t)** (definedness assertion for partial functions)

Equations require both sides to have the same sort. This is a well-sortedness condition on formulas, not merely a convention.

## Algebras and Satisfaction

A **Σ-algebra** A provides:

- A non-empty *carrier set* |A|ₛ for each sort s in S
- A function fᴬ : |A|ₛ₁ × ... × |A|ₛₙ → |A|ₛ for each total function symbol (partial functions may be undefined on some inputs)
- A relation pᴬ ⊆ |A|ₛ₁ × ... × |A|ₛₙ for each predicate symbol

An algebra A **satisfies** an axiom ∀x₁:s₁, ..., xₖ:sₖ • φ when, for every assignment of values from the appropriate carrier sets to the variables, the formula φ evaluates to true under the standard interpretation.

A **specification** SP = (Σ, Φ) consists of a signature Σ and a set of axioms Φ. The **models** of SP are all Σ-algebras that satisfy every axiom in Φ. This is *loose semantics* — we admit all algebras satisfying the axioms, not just the initial or free one.

## Loose, Generated, and Free Semantics

- **Loose**: all Σ-algebras satisfying Φ. This is what our DSL produces. It leaves maximum freedom for implementation.
- **Generated** (no junk): only algebras whose carrier sets are generated by the declared constructors. Every value must be expressible as a constructor term.
- **Free** (no junk, no confusion): generated algebras where distinct constructor terms yield distinct values. This is the standard interpretation of datatypes in programming languages.

The axiom obligation pattern — one axiom per (observer, constructor) pair — arises from structural induction over the free term algebra. If a sort has constructors c₁, ..., cₖ and an observer f, then f is *completely defined* when there is an axiom specifying f(cᵢ(...)) for each i. Missing a constructor case means f is underspecified (loose) on those terms.

## Partial Functions and Definedness

A partial function f : s₁ × ... × sₙ →? s may be undefined for some inputs. CASL distinguishes:

- **Strong equation** (t₁ = t₂): holds when both sides are defined and equal, *or* both undefined.
- **Existential equation** (t₁ =ₑ t₂): holds only when both sides are defined and equal.
- **Definedness** (def(t)): holds when t is defined.

When any argument to a partial function is undefined, the result is undefined (strict error propagation). When any argument to a predicate is undefined, the predicate does not hold.

The typical pattern: partial observers (like `top : Stack →? Elem`) have axioms only for constructors where they're defined (`push`), and no axiom for constructors where they're undefined (`new`). The partiality declaration itself encodes the undefinedness — no explicit "undefined" axiom is needed.

## Signature Morphisms

A **signature morphism** σ : Σ → Σ' maps sorts to sorts and function/predicate symbols to symbols of matching profile. This is how parameterized specs are instantiated: `FiniteMap(Key, Val)` becomes `LibraryCatalog(BookID, Patron)` via a morphism that sends `Key ↦ BookID`, `Val ↦ Patron`, preserving all profiles and axioms.

This matters for the code generation pipeline because each stage effectively constructs a morphism — mapping abstract sorts from the specification to concrete types in the implementation.
